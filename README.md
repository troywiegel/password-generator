# Password Generator Code Refactor

I audited a password generator website and performd a code refactor. In this refactor I:

* Added JavaScript code to meet all of the password generator's needs
* Ensured the HTML code was laid out semantically and the CSS was responsive for all viewports
* Tested the password generator to ensure it was following all of the input criteria and producing accurate passwords
